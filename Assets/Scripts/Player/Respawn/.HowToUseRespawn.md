# The Respawn System
---
When the player's respawn method is invoked it searches for an instance of the ``RespawnPoint`` component that has the same been assigned the player's player component.
The player will then "respawn" on that point by shifting the player `GameObject` to the ``RespawnPoint``'s position.

> __Important! Make sure that there is always an instance representing every player currently in play__
